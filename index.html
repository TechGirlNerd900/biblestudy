                Introduction: The Power of a Divine Encounter
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">
                In the ancient world—particularly in Israel’s religious consciousness—God’s presence was not abstract. A divine encounter meant disruption, transformation, and commissioning. Encounters with God shaped history and human destiny. Today, we explore 12 divine moments that changed the lives of biblical figures. Each story reflects how God not only encountered but also elevated, healed, and transformed these individuals, leading to a better life, greater purpose, and enduring legacy.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
                This version merges deep biblical insight with small group reflection prompts. It can be used for teaching, discipleship, or personal growth.

                God doesn’t just “visit” people—He commissions them, changes them, affirms them, and gives them a future. These twelve stories stretch across centuries, from patriarchs to prophets, kings to commoners, showing that divine encounters are never random—they are invitations into transformation.

                    Inspiration: When you seek God’s wisdom over personal gain, divine favor follows.
                    Life Application: God still gives wisdom generously (James 1:5). Seek His heart first, and He will shape yours.
                    What changed in Solomon’s life after his encounter? He chose wisdom, and as a result, gained wealth and peace. His reign saw unprecedented prosperity (1 Kings 4:20–34). His encounter led to the construction of the temple (1 Kings 6) and worldwide fame (1 Kings 10).
                    How did the cultural context enhance the encounter? Gibeon was a key high place before the temple existed. Solomon's vision comes in a dream, a recognized mode of divine communication.
                    How might this apply to our lives today? God still gives wisdom generously (James 1:5). Seek His heart first, and He will shape yours.

                    Commentary: The ladder (סֻלָּם, *sullam*) symbolizes connection between heaven and earth. Jesus echoes this in John 1:51.
                    Inspiration: God is present even when we feel alone, on the run, or undeserving.
                    Life Application: God finds us in exile and invites us into covenant identity.
                    What changed in Jacob’s life after his encounter? Afterward, he vowed loyalty to God. He returned wealthier (Gen. 32), wrestled with God (Gen. 32:28), and became Israel, the father of a nation. His divine encounter turned a fugitive into a patriarch.
                    How did the cultural context enhance the encounter? Dreams in the ANE were considered sacred channels for divine communication. Bethel (“House of God”) became a significant site of worship.
                    How might this apply to our lives today? God finds us in exile and invites us into covenant identity.
